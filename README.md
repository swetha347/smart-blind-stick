# smart-blind-stick
Smart Blind Stick is an Arduino based project which detects
obstacles using ultrasonic sensors embedded in it.
Whenever obstacles are detected, it vibrates and plays a
buzzing sound which alerts the user of the obstacle's presence.
This mechanism is also useful for deaf people.
This is cost effective when compared to other options like
â€œGuide Dogs"
